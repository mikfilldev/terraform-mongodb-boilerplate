**## Getting Started**

This guide outlines the steps to set up the necessary tools and run the project.

**### Prerequisites**

Before we begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

* **Terraform:** 
    * Download and install Terraform from the official website: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
* **Vagrant:**
    * Download and install Vagrant from the official website: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant)
* **Golang:**
    * Download and install Golang from the official website: [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)
* **Python (>= 3.10):**
    * You may already have Python installed. Verify and download if needed from [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

**### Setting Up Terraform**

1. **Navigate to the `terraformfiles` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd terraformfiles
    ```
2. **Create an environment variable file:**
    * Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`.
    * Edit the newly created `.env` file to provide your specific environment variables according to the instructions in the `.env.example` file.
3. **Initialize Terraform:**
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
4. **Review the Terraform plan:**
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
5. **Apply the Terraform configuration (optional):**
    **_Caution:_** This step will potentially make changes to your environment.  Review the plan output carefully before running this command.
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

**### Testing with Python Client**

**1. Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):**

   a. **Create a virtual environment:**
      ```bash
      cd python-client
      python3 -m venv venv
      ```

   b. **Activate the virtual environment:**
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

**2. Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   (venv)$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**3. Test the MongoDB connection:**

   ```bash
   (venv)$ python3 testmongoconnection.py
   ```

   * This script will attempt to connect to your MongoDB instance using the information provided in the `.env` file.

**### Resources:**

* Terraform Registry: [https://registry.terraform.io/](https://registry.terraform.io/)
* Python `venv` documentation: [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

**## Additional Notes**

* Remember to adjust the environment variables in the `.env` file for Terraform and Python client to match your specific setup.
* The Terraform `apply` command can make permanent changes to your infrastructure. Only run it after carefully reviewing the `terraform plan` output.
* If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation for the respective tools and technologies used in this project.
